# solution-pack-soc-simulator

The FortiSOAR™ SOC Simulator Solution Pack (solution-pack-soc-simulator). This solution pack enables users to experience the power and capability of FortiSOAR™ incident response for SOC Simulator scenarios. This pack contains simulation data and utilities for demonstrating FortiSOAR capabilities around a variety of important SOC use-cases without having to integrate with actual device endpoints.

## Deploying SOC Simulator Solution Pack

**Important**: Before you deploy the solution pack, ensure that you have deployed the FortiSOAR™ Incident Response Solution Pack ([solution-pack-incident-response](https://github.com/fortinet-fortisoar/solution-pack-incident-response)).

The steps for deploying a solution pack are mentioned in the [Deploying a Solution Pack](https://github.com/fortinet-fortisoar/how-tos/blob/main/deploying/deployingASolutionPack.md) article.
